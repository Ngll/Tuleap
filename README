This repository contains some example of jenkins/tuleap integration:

* push_hook.sh
  Implementation of the job that will be triggered by each push in a git 
  repository on Tuleap.

* create_branch.sh
  This script should be called within a git repository. It will create CI jobs
  for each branch that does't has one (tailored for Tuleap use case).

* dispatcher.php
  Works as "receive hook" for Subversion.
  It's supposed to be called when there is a commit on a subversion server.
  It browses the changes made since the last call (persisted in a local file)
  tigger the build of corresponding job with name pattern matching.
